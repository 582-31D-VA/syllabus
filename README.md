apply it to components.

## Modality

This course will be conducted online synchronously. Team classroom links
will be provided before class. Unless otherwise specified, attendance is
mandatory for each class. Lectures will not be recorded. If you are
absent, it is your responsibility to compensate for the missed session.

Outside of class periods, you can reach me through MIO at any time. On

## Assessments

### Bookmarks (10%)

Each week, students will be asked to share a website whose design they
find noteworthy, for one reason or another. Each bookmark will be
accompanied by a short text explaining their choice.

### Reviews (3 × 15%)

During the semester, students will collaborate in teams to redesign a
website of their choice. Every two weeks, they will present their
progress in class for a formal review. Assessment will be based on the
submitted work and the presentation.

### Participation (5%)

Reviews provide students with the opportunity to receive feedback from
their peers. Asking relevant questions during these sessions is a
crucial aspect of the design process. Therefore, students' participation
in the reviews will be assessed based on the thoughtfulness of their
engagement.

### LIA (40%)

Each course includes a Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) that
attests to students' achievement of the course-level learning outcome
that is the main knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed. The
LIA for this course is the final submission of the redesign project
along with all accompanying documentation: research, wireframes,
guidelines, mock-ups, and components.

#### Evaluation Criteria

-   Proposal addresses the initial problems and goals.
-   Wireframes represent the intended functionalities and control flow.
-   Mock-ups are correctly typeset.
-   Colors are harmonious and accessible.
-   Files are well organised.
-   Components are consistently designed.
-   Guidelines are consistently applied.
-   Mock-ups are well decomposed into components.
-   Spacing and alignement are consistent.

### Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (SPLI)

> Student proficiency in the language of instruction is the ability to
> write, read, speak, and listen in order to communicate effectively at
> the college level. SPLI may also require discipline-specific
> vocabulary, documentation, and communication skills; assessment of
> language skills must account for a minimum of 10% of any take-home
> written assignment or oral presentation in which English is the
> language of expression.

10% of the LIA will be devoted to the quality of the final presentation.

### Late Submission Policy

Bookmarks submitted during or after the next class will not be accepted,
resulting in a score of 0.

For other types of submissions, no penalties will be applied if prior
arrangements were made with the teacher *before the submission
deadline*. However, if an assessment is submitted after the deadline
without prior arrangements, a deduction of 5% per day will be applied to
the best possible grade.

### Plagiarism

> Cheating and plagiarism are violations of academic integrity and are
> considered to be very serious academic offenses. They undermine the
> legitimacy of the academic degrees awarded by the College and deny
> honest students of some of the rewards of their efforts.
>
> Plagiarism is submitting or presenting work in a course as if it were
> the student's own original and individual work done expressly for that
> course when, in fact, it is not.
>
> The penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a grade of zero for that
> course work or assignment without the possibility of revising that
> course work or assignment or preparing an alternate assignment.
